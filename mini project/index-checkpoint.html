        <b>About the project</b>
        <p>Based on the Freedom in the World dataset, my report utilized Python to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and
            applied machine leaming techniques such as KNN, SVM, and Naive Bayes to predict whether a country is classified as
            Free (F) Partly Free (PF), or Not Free (NF). A Flask app was developed to allow the company to make predictions on a
            web page. The project demonstrates a deep understanding of machine learning techniques and their application to
            real-world problems, while also highlighting the potential for technology to be used to promote social justice and
            human rights. Overall, the app has the potential to provide valuable insights into the state of political and civil liberties</p>
